# mugen (無限)
## The mu stands for
Monetary Unit (MU, M.U., mu or μ)

**work-in-progress**

The monetary standardization of goods and services based on potable distilled water where:
- distilled water fit for biological consumption by human beings (particulary infants and the elderly) is taken as a categorical datum of zero (0).
- nuclear waste from fissile or spent radioactive material from any type of research and development (R&D) is taken as the categorical datum of minus one (-1).
- unconstrained, atmospheric helium that is not part of economic production activities is taken as the categorical datum of plus one (+1).

The categorical range conceived between minus one to zero and zero to plus one is losslessly compressed into a computable ordinal interval of `(-1,0]` and `[0,+1)` respectively where:
  + intervals, each of size -1 < 0 < +1, are partitioned geometrically along an *orthonormal* dimensional vector space where the dot product (inner product) of any two normed vectors, produces an indexible node or "shape". 
  + In this normed vector space, each recursively indexable portion called a node is assigned a (dynamically encripted) cybernetics URI. 
  Similar to URI: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier
  + **Important note:** Let -1 coincide with *-Inf* and 1 coincide with *Inf* while 0 remains 0. Dialating the real number interval `(-1, 1)` in this manner to `(-Inf, Inf)` with arbitrary precission is unnecessary if the compression algorithm has appropriate girth while unambiguously encoding and decoding an indexible node, within `(-1, 1)`, along or about a particular dimension i.e. axis. Here, "along" implies translational operations and "about" implies rotational operations. The discrete number of dimensions i.e. axes that can be used for constructing the required topological space that can index each evolving URI becomes a challenge in itself. For this reason while an analog system can parse fractional dimensions with greatest possible accuracy and precission of its *n dimensional* topology, a digital system can only parse fixed precission discrete numbers with bounded neighborhoods (regions) in its *n-1 dimensional* topology. 

    It is also computationally problematic and recursively expensive, in material resources sense, to functionally assign (i.e. map) the given real number span of `(-1,1)` including the symmetric bisector of that span at 0, to any other real number span i.e. ordinal range or indexible space such as: 
    - `(-1, -1/2] and [-1/2, 0)`
    - `(0, 1/2] and [1/2, 1]` 
    - `(ω<sub>0</sub>,ω<sub>ω</sub>)` or `(ω<sub>0</sub>,ω<sup>ω</sup>)` 
    where, **ω<sub>0</sub>** represents a set of transfinite ordinal numbers with a possible ordinal limit at some *ω* such that no such ordinal number *α* can exist in the form *α + 1 = ω*. 
    See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_ordinal and 
         https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_uncountable_ordinal
         https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_number 
         (Transfinitism is merely the idea of using **mod** *Inf* arithmetic, with as many iterations of "counting" done, as possible, at each instance of reaching *Inf*, along as many dimensions as possible, using **mod** *inf* counting method for each such real numbered dimension.)

    For comprehending the topics of:
 
      Invarience i.e. accuracy in analytics and 

      The partition of a unit of an analysable entity 

      It is truly worth noting the contributions of lytics

### Note:
Distilled water's relationship to and usages as ultrapurified water is the key factor and most important rationale in this cybernetics based versioning of petrochemical feul economics.

It can be shown that most petrochemical products, their production and the entire process of fossil fuel excavation is negatively valued in comparision to double-distilled tap water. Considering that double-distilled tap water of most jurisdictions on earth is fit for human consumption without additives along with healthy diet and exercise, any type of activity or process that reduces this intrinsic capacity of double-distilled tap water is sub-par or at-best on-par with the mere availablility of proven, local ground water resources.

## As noted
1 litre or 1 kilogram of purified (double distilled) <sup>1</sup>H<sub>2</sub><sup>16</sup>O water such that: 
  - its **molar** concentration of hydronium ion count <sub>n</sub>[H<sub>3</sub>0<sup>+</sup>] with respect to hydroxyl ion count <sub>n</sub>[OH<sup>-</sup>] within, 
  - aqueous solution state has, 
  - at most 1 part per trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) mol/mol fraction of non H<sub>2</sub>0 based components or impurities at, 
  - available, accessible and attainable thermogravimetric datum and, 
  - electrochemical potential datum which,
  - are well within a maximum of 1.2 gigapascal (1.2e9 pascal) pressure at the interaction layer of, 
  - the constrained water sample with its environment.

Note that datum translators, transducers, translations, transcriptions and traversals are always, within and by, themselves subject to, some external datum, external to - every perceived or preconceived - bindings, biddings, forebodings, innings, scope or namespace definitions of any analytical translations or transliterations. 

This external and unaccountable datum is free and seemingly unbound. Though this absolute datum must not be dismissed or taken for granted nor should it be taken as "common grounds" for the roughly free-willed agent-observer (observer-agent) nor for the roughly free account of an accountable situation, it is and might as well be, counted upon to exist. Such a conception is defined even if the observer is unobservant of any such conceivable or inconceivable, exegient datum. 

So, what then is "relative" or "relativity" if one submits to and includes an idea of The Absolute as a witness? Relevance of an account that is, recordable measurements, is always relative to life. Though it can be subject to warranted scrutiny and is quite simply subjective, it is most definitely proportioned to a relationship with and from life. #propotionalizing

As always, this proportionate measure is relational to the portable account. Such was said by a Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) and came to be interpreted within this form. 

## And considering cases of
- Zero Gravity Environment: (Un)constrained, free-falling, free-floating water in deep space
- Hyper-gravity Environment: Highly pressurized, at or near solidous state of water within a macro-cellular region of n-D timespace, n from 3 to 3, and 4 to 3 projected. That is, take 4D's projections onto a 3D space.
