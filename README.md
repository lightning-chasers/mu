##The mu stands for
Monetary Unit (MU, M.U. or mu)

## As noted
1 litre or 1 kilogram of (strictly) potable water such that: 
  - its **molar** concentration of hydronium ion count <sub>n</sub>[H<sub>3</sub>0<sup>+</sup>] with respect to hydroxyl ion count <sub>n</sub>[OH<sup>-</sup>] within, 
  - aqueous solution state that has, 
  - at most 1 part per trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) of non H<sub>2</sub>0 based components or impurities at, 
  - available, accessible and attainable thermogravimetric datum and, 
  - eclectrochemical potential datum (^_~),
  - well within a maximum of seven (7) gigapascal pressure at the interaction layer of, 
  - the constrained water sample with its environment.

Note that datum translators, transducers, translations, transcriptions and traversals are always, within and by, themselves subject to, some external datum, external to - every perceived or preconceived - bindings, biddings, forebodings, innings, scope or namespace definitions of any analytical translations or transliterations. 

This external and unaccountable datum is free and seemingly unbound. Though this absolute datum must not to, be dismissed or taken for granted nor should it be taken as "common grounds" for the roughly free-willed agent-observer (observer-agent) nor for the roughly free account of an accountable situation, it is and might as well be, counted upon to exist. Such a conception is defined even if the observer is unobservant of any such conceivable or inconceivable, exegient datum. 

So, what then is "relative" or "relativity" if one submits to and includes an idea of The Absolute as a witness? Relevance of an account that is, recordable measurements, is always relative to life. Though it can be subject to warranted scrutiny and is quite simply subjective, it is most definitely proportioned to a relationship with and from life. #propotionalizing

As always, this proportionate measure is relational to the portable account. Such was said by a Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) and came to be interpreted within this form. 

## And considering cases of
- Zero Gravity Environment: (Un)constrained, free-falling, free-floating water in deep space
- Hyper-gravity Environment: Highly pressurized, at or near solidous state of water within a macro-cellular region of n-D timespace, n from 3 to 3, and 4 to 3 projected. That is, take 4D's projections onto a 3D space.
