## The mu stands for
Monetary Unit (MU, M.U. or mu)

**work-in-progress**

The monetary standardization of goods and services based on potable distilled water where:
- distilled water fit for biological consumption by human beings (particulary infants and the elderly) is taken as a categorical datum of zero (0).
- nuclear waste from fissile or spent radioactive material from any type of research and development (R&D) is taken as the categorical datum of minus one (-1).
- unconstrained, atmospheric helium that is not part of economic production activities is taken as the categorical datum of plus one (+1).

The categorical range conceived between minus one to zero and zero to plus one is losslessly compressed into a computable range of (-1,0] and [0,+1) respectively where:
  + ranges, each of size -1 < 0 < +1, are partitioned geometrically along an *orthonormal* dimensional vector space where the dot product (inner product) of any two normed vectors, produce an indexible node or "shape". 
  + In this normed vector space, each recursively indexable portion called a node is assigned a (dynamically encripted) cybernetics URI.

Distilled water's relationship to and usages as ultrapurified water is the key factor and most important rationale in this cybernetics based versioning of petrochemical feul economics.

It can be shown that most petrochemical products, their production and the entire process of fossil fuel excavation is negatively valued in comparision to double-distilled tap water. Considering that double-distilled tap water of most jurisdictions on earth is fit for human consumption without additives along with healthy diet and exercise, any form of activity or process that reduces this consumable capacity of double-distilled tap water is sub par or at best on par with the merely availablility of ground water.

## As noted
1 litre or 1 kilogram of purified <sup>1</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O water such that: 
  - its **molar** concentration of hydronium ion count <sub>n</sub>[H<sub>3</sub>0<sup>+</sup>] with respect to hydroxyl ion count <sub>n</sub>[OH<sup>-</sup>] within, 
  - aqueous solution state that has, 
  - at most 1 part per trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) of non H<sub>2</sub>0 based components or impurities at, 
  - available, accessible and attainable thermogravimetric datum and, 
  - eclectrochemical potential datum (^_~),
  - well within a maximum of seven (7) gigapascal pressure at the interaction layer of, 
  - the constrained water sample with its environment.

Note that datum translators, transducers, translations, transcriptions and traversals are always, within and by, themselves subject to, some external datum, external to - every perceived or preconceived - bindings, biddings, forebodings, innings, scope or namespace definitions of any analytical translations or transliterations. 

This external and unaccountable datum is free and seemingly unbound. Though this absolute datum must not to, be dismissed or taken for granted nor should it be taken as "common grounds" for the roughly free-willed agent-observer (observer-agent) nor for the roughly free account of an accountable situation, it is and might as well be, counted upon to exist. Such a conception is defined even if the observer is unobservant of any such conceivable or inconceivable, exegient datum. 

So, what then is "relative" or "relativity" if one submits to and includes an idea of The Absolute as a witness? Relevance of an account that is, recordable measurements, is always relative to life. Though it can be subject to warranted scrutiny and is quite simply subjective, it is most definitely proportioned to a relationship with and from life. #propotionalizing

As always, this proportionate measure is relational to the portable account. Such was said by a Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) and came to be interpreted within this form. 

## And considering cases of
- Zero Gravity Environment: (Un)constrained, free-falling, free-floating water in deep space
- Hyper-gravity Environment: Highly pressurized, at or near solidous state of water within a macro-cellular region of n-D timespace, n from 3 to 3, and 4 to 3 projected. That is, take 4D's projections onto a 3D space.
- Imperfect, dynamic environments as in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aesthetics
